    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a content-first portfolio built to present experience, projects, and technical leadership in a
      clean format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stack is currently being modernized to Astro + TypeScript + Decap CMS with Netlify configuration fully
      codified in source.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is practical clarity: professional storytelling backed by credible technical execution.
