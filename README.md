## About Me

I’m a mission-driven technology leader with 15+ years of experience building, modernizing, and scaling mission-critical software platforms. I’ve led engineering organizations from early inception to 30+ employees, delivered long-lived enterprise systems across global teams, and defined multi-year product and technology roadmaps aligned with business strategy.

My background spans early-stage startups, enterprise product development at Microsoft, and building and leading a profitable software organization delivering complex platform systems in regulated and data-intensive domains.

## What I Build

I specialize in durable systems and scalable platforms:

• Cloud-native architectures (AWS, IaC, containers, microservices)  
• Enterprise integrations (SAP, Salesforce, distributed systems)  
• Platform abstraction layers for multi-product ecosystems  
• Observability and reliability systems (OpenTelemetry, metrics, tracing)  
• Long-lived systems that evolve without rewrite  

I care about systems that survive years — not demos that survive days.

## Selected Platform Experience

### Global Agricultural Platform Modernization
Led the evolution of a regional sustainability tool into a globally deployed digital recommendation platform.

• Migrated legacy .NET Framework/Azure systems to AWS cloud-native architecture  
• Implemented Infrastructure-as-Code (AWS CDK) to replace click-ops  
• Designed microservice and event-driven architectures  
• Integrated SAP, Salesforce, and multiple enterprise systems  
• Established production observability (metrics, logs, traces)  
• Completed SOC2 audit with minimal remediation  

---

### Distributed Platform Engineering
Built and mentored globally distributed teams across the US, India, Brazil, Egypt, and Europe.

• Defined shared services and abstraction layers to eliminate duplication  
• Coordinated cross-product platform alignment  
• Transitioned mature systems to internal ownership for sustainability

### Early Mobile & Data Systems
Before cloud-native was common, I worked on:

• Terabyte-scale weather data processing systems (early 2000s)  
• Custom database performance optimizations  
• Early mobile (Pocket PC) GPS-based geospatial applications  
• Streaming web data before modern AJAX frameworks

## Engineering Leadership Philosophy

I believe strong engineering organizations balance:

• Clear metrics with healthy culture  
• Accountability with psychological safety  
• Modern tooling with operational discipline  
• Innovation with long-term sustainability  

I build teams that ship — and systems that last.
