# About this site

This (static, client-only) site is created using a stack of:

* Gatsby
  * Uses GraphQL to query for the timeline entries, and access the page content written in Markdown.
* React
  * Mostly functional components with hooks.
* Typescript 
* Netlify CMS
  * Uses the github repo as a datastore for Markdown content files, editable from within the site directly. 
* SASS

And it is hosted on Netlify with continuous deployment from the GitHub repo
