Designed and implemented early mobile field applications for Pocket PC devices, enabling in-field scouting, disease tracking, and GPS-based boundary creation.

I helped re-architect agricultural and weather data pipelines processing terabyte-scale daily datasets, improving throughput and operational reliability for downstream modeling and reporting.

Key contributions included a custom MySQL table handling approach to improve high-volume read/write behavior, a RAW-image disease modeling visualization pipeline for analyst workflows, and a hardware-level GPS compatibility workaround that resolved intermittent field-device integration constraints.
