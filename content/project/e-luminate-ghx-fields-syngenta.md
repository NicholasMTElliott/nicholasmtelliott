Led the evolution of a long-running platform from an initial sustainability-focused system into Syngenta's mission-critical digital seed recommendation and portfolio solution.

The platform evolved from Knockout/.NET Framework on Azure to TypeScript/React plus .NET Core and Node.js services, with global integrations across Salesforce, SAP, and internal systems.

Major initiatives included portfolio recommendation engines, digital catalog generation, and a full cloud modernization program that transitioned Azure click-ops infrastructure to AWS CDK Infrastructure-as-Code.

The architecture moved toward microservices and event-driven service boundaries, including secure VPC segmentation, centralized secrets management, and containerized workloads on Fargate where appropriate for operational scaling.

I led implementation of production observability and reliability practices using OpenTelemetry and Grafana-backed telemetry pipelines (Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo), and supported successful SOC 2 audit completion through repeatable controls and operational process maturity.

Delivery required sustained coordination across stakeholders and engineering groups in the US, India, Brazil, Egypt, and Europe. As core capabilities matured, I guided platform abstraction efforts to reduce duplication across product lines and executed transition-to-internal-team plans so Syngenta teams could own ongoing roadmap and operations.
