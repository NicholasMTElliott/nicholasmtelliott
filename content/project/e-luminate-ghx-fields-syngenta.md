Led the evolution of a long-running platform from an initial sustainability-focused system into Syngenta's mission-critical digital seed recommendation and portfolio solution.

The platform evolved from Knockout/.NET Framework on Azure to TypeScript/React plus .NET Core and Node.js services, with global integrations across Salesforce, SAP, and internal systems.

Major initiatives included portfolio recommendation engines, digital catalog generation, AWS migration via CDK, and observability/reliability/compliance practices.
