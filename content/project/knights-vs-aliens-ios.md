Knights vs Aliens was intentionally scoped for rapid delivery and shipped in approximately three months.

The game was engineered for constrained mobile hardware, with practical tradeoffs in rendering complexity, thread utilization, and memory pressure to preserve stable frame behavior during fast iteration.

The project reached profitability through disciplined MVP boundaries and execution speed, reinforcing a repeatable product lesson from Prophetic Sky: self-funded work succeeds when technical ambition is matched to strict operational constraints.
