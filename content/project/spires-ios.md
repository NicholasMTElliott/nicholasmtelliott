Spires was a large-scale strategy game developed over roughly two years, reaching several thousand paid users.

Building for early iPhone hardware required careful performance optimization across rendering paths, multithreaded work scheduling, and memory layout decisions to keep gameplay responsive on constrained devices.

Because the product was self-funded, architecture and scope decisions were tied directly to operational discipline. The release provided practical lessons in distribution economics, piracy impact, and the limits of long-cycle MVP strategy in consumer mobile markets.
