ZedX was a research-driven technology company focused on agricultural modeling, weather analytics, and decision-support software.

Working in a high-autonomy environment, I built early mobile and geospatial workflows, improved large-scale data processing performance, and helped deliver mission-critical tools used by agribusiness stakeholders.

### Engineering & Platform Leadership

I contributed to core platform capabilities that had to perform reliably under field and hardware constraints. This period established my long-term approach to systems work: solve the technical bottleneck directly, keep architecture practical, and design for sustained operational use rather than short-lived prototypes.
