ZedX was a research-driven technology company focused on agricultural modeling, weather analytics, and decision-support software.

Working in a high-autonomy environment, I built early mobile and geospatial workflows, improved large-scale data processing performance, and helped deliver mission-critical tools used by agribusiness stakeholders.
