At Microsoft, I worked across both test engineering and product engineering on large-scale desktop software systems.

This period sharpened my understanding of enterprise delivery practices, cross-team coordination, and the trade-offs that appear in long-horizon product planning.

### Engineering & Platform Leadership

I operated across quality and product delivery responsibilities in mature software programs with high release discipline. The experience established foundational patterns I have carried forward in later leadership roles: structured execution, clear ownership boundaries, and systems decisions that remain maintainable over multi-year product cycles.
