I founded and led Skyward App Company, LLC as a bespoke software development and platform engineering firm focused on enterprise, regulated, and data-intensive domains.

Over this period, we scaled from a solo operation to roughly 30 employees and reached peak annual revenue of approximately $3.4M while delivering long-lived systems for clients across agriculture, manufacturing, and enterprise software.
