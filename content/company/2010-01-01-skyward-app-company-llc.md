I founded and led Skyward App Company, LLC as a bespoke software development and platform engineering firm focused on enterprise, regulated, and data-intensive domains.

Over this period, we scaled from a solo operation to roughly 30 employees and reached peak annual revenue of approximately $3.4M while delivering long-lived systems for clients across agriculture, manufacturing, and enterprise software.

### Engineering & Platform Leadership

I led multi-year modernization programs spanning cloud architecture, platform engineering, and product delivery while coordinating stakeholders and delivery teams across the US, India, Brazil, Egypt, and Europe. The organization maintained low turnover through mentorship-centered team structures, explicit ownership, and a deliberate focus on durable systems over short-term project churn.

As systems matured, I emphasized transition-to-internal-team strategies so client organizations could sustainably own operations, roadmap execution, and ongoing platform evolution.
