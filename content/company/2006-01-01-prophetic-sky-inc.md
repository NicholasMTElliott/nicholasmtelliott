Prophetic Sky, Inc. was an independent mobile product studio I founded during the early iPhone era.

The company balanced original game development with contract software delivery, creating a practical proving ground for MVP execution, mobile performance work, and product-market learning.

### Engineering & Platform Leadership

I led architecture and delivery across both product and client work while operating under self-funded constraints. That operating model required disciplined prioritization, careful scope control, and technical decisions that balanced performance, maintainability, and time-to-market on early mobile hardware.
